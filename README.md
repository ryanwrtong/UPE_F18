# UPE_F18
Solution to Fall 18 UPE Coding Challenge.

To run on chrome: chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security

Refresh console using F5 after a level is completed to go to next ones.



To run on node.js: npm install xmlhttprequest

Then, include: 
var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;

node codingchallenge.js

However, since node doesn't have XMLHttpRequest(), which is for web browsers, it is preferred to run in a web browser.
